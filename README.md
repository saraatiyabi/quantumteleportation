<h1>Quabtum Teleportation</h1>
 Quantum teleportation is a technique for moving quantum states around, even in the absence of a quantum communications channel linking the sender of the quantum state to the recipient.
 in this repo we implemented a circuit for quantum teleportation. This function inputs a gate which prepares the message qubit in some state to transmit from Alice to Bob.
